## About The Project
![Project Preview][project-preview]

<br> ✔️ Support for persona skin (it created via character creators)
<br> ✔️ Now you don't have to see a skin filled with random colors

#### :question: What is a **persona skin**?
**Persona skin** is a new format of skin created via the [**character creator**](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Character_creator)  
It was added in [Bedrock_Edition_1.13.0](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition_1.13.0)
- PMMP does not support this skin format, and makes it show as a skin filled with random colors.
